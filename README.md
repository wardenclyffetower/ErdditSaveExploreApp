# ErrditSaveExplore

A PRAW script to explore your reddit account saved posts.

## Ok but why ?

If you are like me, you often save a reddit post as a way to keep it and read it later. But then you
forget about it, and never read it again. This script is a way to explore your saved posts, and
maybe find some gems you forgot about.

## Installation

TODO

## Configuration

As a PRAW script, credentials are kept on a praw.ini file. See [PRAW
documentation](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html)
